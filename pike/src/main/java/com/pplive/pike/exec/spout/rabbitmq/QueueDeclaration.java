 * Declaration of a queue to consume, and any exchange bindings the queue needs.

 * <p>Depending on the queue parameters (exclusive, auto_delete, server-named)
 * and exchange bindings, it may or may not be safe to start several consumers
 * in parallel using a given queue declaration.  For example, an exclusive
 * named queue bound to an exchange is not safe because only one of the
 * consumers will succeed in declaring the queue; an exclusive
 * <em>server-named</em> queue does not have that problem, but is still
 * probably not safe, because most exchange types will send a copy of every
 * message to every queue bound to them, so you will end up consuming each
 * message several times.</p>
 *
 * <p>For that reason, to implement this interface you must implement
 * {@link #isParallelConsumable} to indicate whether or not this queue is safe
 * for parallel consumers.</p>
